# Additional Observations
observations:
  unexpected_behaviors: Maybe not a behavior, but I couldn't find the "rollback" in the logs
  suggested_improvements: I loved the project and only have a few small suggestions. 1. Please mention up front that answers.yaml will need to be populated as an outcome of this 'homework.' Had I known this in advance, I would have taken notes as I went along with the exercises. Instead, I 'played' with the demo, cleaned the terminal's output, and as a result had to do a few parts from scratch. Nevertheless, it was fun, so I can't really complain about it :) Another part is the Prometheus / Grafana - somehow I didn't figure out how the `http_requests_total` are collected and was not able to get part of the answers. Maybe few more minutes in the Walkthrough part would help (unless I missed this somehow). Anyway, I hope it helps :)
